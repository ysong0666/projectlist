By using Tableau to confirm our list of hypotheses, we narrowed them down to a couple, mostly focusing on visitor car itineraries. For example, we converted a bitmap of the reserve into a graph and used graph algorithms to detect speeding and trespassing. Then we implemented multiple coordinated visualizations with interactive features to visualize abnormal patterns of visitor cars in the preserve."
